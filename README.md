Repo for my portfolio site

My portfolio site, currently without domain, got its October goals completed! You can find (most) of the pages on this repository. Everything is kept locally, but I do store the password (hashed of course) directly within PHP so I some files are ignored :)

I'm not looking for any help on this repo, as its my own project I will work on as time goes on, but wanted to make it public so people can go ahead and learn from it or find something that helps them
